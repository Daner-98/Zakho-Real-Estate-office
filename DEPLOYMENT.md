3. Change the username and password values to something secure

## Data Persistence

Note that this application stores data in JSON files. In a production environment:
1. For static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages): Data will not persist between sessions
2. For server hosting (Heroku, Render): Data will persist but may be lost during dyno restarts

For production use, consider implementing a proper database solution.

## Support

For any deployment issues, check the documentation of your chosen hosting platform or contact their support.
